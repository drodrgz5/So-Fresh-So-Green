- `npm run package-win`

Command to create an executable and an installer with electron builder:

Bug Patches
-----------

Due to how pop-ups at the beginning of the programs run time the current test suite can break.
Steps to temporary fix this until code and tests are re-factored.
1. Make sure settings.json is deleted
2. Run the program once yourself
3. Set PDF Alchemist to default.
4. Close the program.
5. Should be able to run "npm run test-master" now with all tests but one test passing (one test is incomplete and will finish as pending).
